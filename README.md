# SCALE
**SCALE** (Soil Carbon and Landscape co-Evolution) is an open source software for simulating the co-evolution of landscape and soil organic carbon across a watershed scale with lidar DEM resolution from daily to centuries. 
DOI for this repository: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4021657

## Getting Started
There are two study sites to use and contribute to the SCALE model. One study is at a sub-catchement in the Clear Creek Watershed, and the folder that includes the source codes and forcing data is under 'SCALE-CCW'. Another study is in the consolidated gully land in the Chinese Loess Plateau, and the folder that includes the source codes and forcing data is under 'SCALE-GLC'.
